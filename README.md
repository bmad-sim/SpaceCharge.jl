# SpaceCharge.jl

SpaceCharge.jl is a high-performance Julia package for 3D space-charge calculations, supporting both CPU and GPU acceleration. It is designed for scientific computing applications such as beam physics and accelerator modeling.

## Algorithm and Citation

This package implements a parallel fast Fourier transform (FFT) based 3D space charge algorithm using integrated Green functions, as described in:

> Mayes, Christopher and Ryne, Robert and Sagan, David. "3D Space Charge in Bmad." 9th International Particle Accelerator Conference, 2018. [doi:10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAK085](https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAK085)

The original Fortran implementation is available at: [https://github.com/RobertRyne/OpenSpaceCharge](https://github.com/RobertRyne/OpenSpaceCharge)

The package provides high-level routines to:
- Deposit weighted charged particles on a 3D rectangular grid.
- Calculate the space charge fields on this grid.
- Interpolate the field to an arbitrary point within its domain.

Convolutions of the Green functions and the charge density are performed efficiently with FFTs.

## Installation

To install SpaceCharge.jl, open the Julia REPL and run:
