    generate_igf_kernel!(green_function_array, grid_size, delta, component_idx)

A kernel to compute the Integrated Green's Function (IGF) for a given component.

This kernel will call the translated `lafun2`/`xlafun2` functions and perform
the 8-point differencing to get the integrated value for each cell.

# Arguments
- `green_function_array`: The array to store the computed Green's function.
- `grid_size`: A tuple (nx, ny, nz) representing the size of the grid.
- `delta`: A tuple (dx, dy, dz) representing the grid spacing.
- `component_idx`: An integer (1, 2, or 3) indicating which component (x, y, or z) of the field the Green's function is for.
